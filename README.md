# Kobold RPG
This is a game being made for [GGJ 2024](https://globalgamejam.org/).

# Getting started
You're first going to need to clone the repo.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/queercat/kobold-rpg
```

Then you'll need to import the project into Godot.

1. Open up Godot. 
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> If you're in an active project you'll need to close out and restart to get to project menu.
2. Get into the project menu.
3. Import and navigate to the path where you've put the cloned repository.

# Contributing
There is an [active project](https://github.com/users/queercat/projects/3) that is tracking the TODOs and what is being done. 
Any TODOs in the backlog are safe to pull of and be worked on.

If you believe there might be conflicting work feel free to separate out what you need into a branch and create a PR onto this.
